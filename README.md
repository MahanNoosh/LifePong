# LifePong
A creative game by combination of two games named Pong and Conway's Game Of Life. 
# Rules:
at the beginning of the game each player has 40 cells to place (make alive) on their side of board. These and the future generations of them will work as puddles of original pong game.
At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

After placing cells you can press space to start the game. It runs at 30 fps which means 30 generations happens each second. Have fun I guess :D
